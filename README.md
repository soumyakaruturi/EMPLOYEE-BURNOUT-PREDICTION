# Employee Burnout Prediction

## Overview
Employee burnout is a major organizational challenge, resulting in reduced productivity, increased turnover, and decreased workplace satisfaction. This project uses data-driven machine learning techniques to predict burnout risk based on workplace attributes, enabling timely interventions to support employee well-being and organizational efficiency.[1][2][3]

***

## Features

- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify burnout risk factors.
- Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering for model readiness.
- Multiple machine learning models implemented and compared (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Boosting).
- Model tuning and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Interpretability: Feature selection and analysis to highlight key drivers of employee burnout.
- (Optional) Web app for user-friendly burnout prediction and risk assessment.

***

## Dataset

- Contains diverse employee records with attributes such as designation, work-from-home availability, tenure, satisfaction scores, stress indicators, and more.
- Data sourced from HR departments, survey responses, and public burnout datasets.
- Target variable: Burnout score or risk level (can be categorical or regression-based).

## Project Structure

- **data/** — raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks/** — Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and results
- **models/** — saved model files
- **app.py/** — main file for the web application interface (if present)
- **reports/** — analysis presentations and reports
- **requirements.txt/** — dependencies list.
- **static/** and **templates/** — web app assets

***

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soumyakaruturi/EMPLOYEE-BURNOUT-PREDICTION.git
cd EMPLOYEE-BURNOUT-PREDICTION
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***

## Usage

1. Download or provide employee burnout data in the data folder.
2. Run EDA and model training notebooks and scripts.
3. Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importances.
4. (Optional) Launch the web app for interactive predictions:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

***

## Results

- Present confusion matrix, ROC curve, classification reports, and feature importance rankings.
- Insights into major burnout drivers and recommendations for intervention.
- Share summary tables or visualizations from the analysis.
